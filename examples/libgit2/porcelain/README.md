This directory contains demo versions of the git "porcelain" commands - the 
higher level commands that are generally used at the command level. The code
is based on the examples in the libgit2 repository.

The scripts are intended to be invoked from the shell, e.g.

```
tclsh git-init.tcl ~/repo
```

Specify the `--help` command line option with each script for a usage summary.
